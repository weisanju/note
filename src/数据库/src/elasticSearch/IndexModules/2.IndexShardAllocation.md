## Index Shard Allocation

This module provides per-index settings to control the allocation of shards to nodes:

- [Shard allocation filtering](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/shard-allocation-filtering.html): Controlling which shards are allocated to which nodes.
- [Delayed allocation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/delayed-allocation.html): Delaying allocation of unassigned shards caused by a node leaving.
- [Total shards per node](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/allocation-total-shards.html): A hard limit on the number of shards from the same index per node.
- [Data tier allocation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/data-tier-shard-filtering.html): Controls the allocation of indices to [data tiers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/data-tiers.html).

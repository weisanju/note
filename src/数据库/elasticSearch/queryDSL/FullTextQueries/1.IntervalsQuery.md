## Intervals query

Returns documents based on the order and proximity of matching terms.

The `intervals` query uses **matching rules**, constructed from a small set of definitions. 

These rules are then applied to terms from a specified `field`.

The definitions produce sequences of minimal intervals that span terms in a body of text. These intervals can be further combined and filtered by parent sources.

## Example request

The following `intervals` search returns documents containing `my favorite food` without any gap, followed by `hot water` or `cold porridge` in the `my_text` field.

This search would match a `my_text` value of `my favorite food is cold porridge` but not `when it's cold my favorite food is porridge`.

```json
POST _search
{
  "query": { 
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "all_of" : {
          "ordered" : true,
          "intervals" : [
            {
              "match" : {
                "query" : "my favorite food",
                "max_gaps" : 0,
                "ordered" : true
              }
            },
            {
              "any_of" : {
                "intervals" : [
                  { "match" : { "query" : "hot water" } },
                  { "match" : { "query" : "cold porridge" } }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Top-level parameters for `intervals`

- **`<field>`**

  (必填，规则对象) 您希望搜索的字段。此参数的值是一个规则对象，用于根据匹配的术语、顺序和接近度来匹配文档。Valid rules include:[`match`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-match)[`prefix`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-prefix)[`wildcard`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-wildcard)[`fuzzy`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-fuzzy)[`all_of`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-all_of)[`any_of`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#intervals-any_of)



### `match` rule parameters

The `match` rule matches analyzed text.

- **`query`**

  (Required, string) Text you wish to find in the provided `<field>`.

- **`max_gaps`**

  (Optional, integer) Maximum number of positions between the matching terms. Terms further apart than this are not considered matches. Defaults to `-1`.If unspecified or set to `-1`, there is no width restriction on the match. If set to `0`, the terms must appear next to each other.

- **`ordered`**

  (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, matching terms must appear in their specified order. Defaults to `false`.

- **`analyzer`**

  (Optional, string) [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/analysis.html) used to analyze terms in the `query`. Defaults to the top-level `<field>`'s analyzer.

- **`filter`**

  (Optional, [interval filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#interval_filter) rule object) An optional interval filter.

- **`use_field`**

  (Optional, string) If specified, then match intervals from this field rather than the top-level `<field>`. Terms are analyzed using the search analyzer from this field. This allows you to search across multiple fields as if they were all the same field; for example, you could index the same text into stemmed and unstemmed fields, and search for stemmed tokens near unstemmed ones.



### `prefix` rule parameters

The `prefix` rule matches terms that start with a specified set of characters. This prefix can expand to match at most 128 terms. If the prefix matches more than 128 terms, Elasticsearch returns an error. You can use the [`index-prefixes`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/index-prefixes.html) option in the field mapping to avoid this limit.

- **`prefix`**

  (Required, string) Beginning characters of terms you wish to find in the top-level `<field>`.

- **`analyzer`**

  (Optional, string) [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/analysis.html) used to normalize the `prefix`. Defaults to the top-level `<field>`'s analyzer.

- **`use_field`**

  (Optional, string) If specified, then match intervals from this field rather than the top-level `<field>`.The `prefix` is normalized using the search analyzer from this field, unless a separate `analyzer` is specified.



### `wildcard` rule parameters

The `wildcard` rule matches terms using a wildcard pattern. This pattern can expand to match at most 128 terms. If the pattern matches more than 128 terms, Elasticsearch returns an error.

- **`pattern`**

  (Required, string) Wildcard pattern used to find matching terms.This parameter supports two wildcard operators:`?`, which matches any single character`*`, which can match zero or more characters, including an empty oneAvoid beginning patterns with `*` or `?`. This can increase the iterations needed to find matching terms and slow search performance.

- **`analyzer`**

  (Optional, string) [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/analysis.html) used to normalize the `pattern`. Defaults to the top-level `<field>`'s analyzer.

- **`use_field`**

  (Optional, string) If specified, match intervals from this field rather than the top-level `<field>`.The `pattern` is normalized using the search analyzer from this field, unless `analyzer` is specified separately.



### `fuzzy` rule parameters

The `fuzzy` rule matches terms that are similar to the provided term, within an edit distance defined by [Fuzziness](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/common-options.html#fuzziness). If the fuzzy expansion matches more than 128 terms, Elasticsearch returns an error.

- **`term`**

  (Required, string) The term to match

- **`prefix_length`**

  (Optional, integer) Number of beginning characters left unchanged when creating expansions. Defaults to `0`.

- **`transpositions`**

  (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether edits include transpositions of two adjacent characters (ab → ba). Defaults to `true`.

- **`fuzziness`**

  (Optional, string) Maximum edit distance allowed for matching. See [Fuzziness](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/common-options.html#fuzziness) for valid values and more information. Defaults to `auto`.

- **`analyzer`**

  (Optional, string) [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/analysis.html) used to normalize the `term`. Defaults to the top-level `<field>` 's analyzer.

- **`use_field`**

  (Optional, string) If specified, match intervals from this field rather than the top-level `<field>`.The `term` is normalized using the search analyzer from this field, unless `analyzer` is specified separately.

### `all_of` rule parameters

The `all_of` rule returns matches that span a combination of other rules.

- **`intervals`**

  (Required, array of rule objects) An array of rules to combine. All rules must produce a match in a document for the overall source to match.

- **`max_gaps`**

  (Optional, integer) Maximum number of positions between the matching terms. Intervals produced by the rules further apart than this are not considered matches. Defaults to `-1`.If unspecified or set to `-1`, there is no width restriction on the match. If set to `0`, the terms must appear next to each other.

  (可选，整数) 匹配项之间的最大位置数。比这更远的规则产生的间隔不被视为匹配。默认值为-1。如果未指定或设置为-1，则匹配项没有宽度限制。如果设置为0，则术语必须彼此相邻出现。

  

- **`ordered`**

  (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, intervals produced by the rules should appear in the order in which they are specified. Defaults to `false`.

- **`filter`**

  (Optional, [interval filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#interval_filter) rule object) Rule used to filter returned intervals.

### `any_of` rule parameters

The `any_of` rule returns intervals produced by any of its sub-rules.

- **`intervals`**

  (Required, array of rule objects) An array of rules to match.

- **`filter`**

  (Optional, [interval filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#interval_filter) rule object) Rule used to filter returned intervals.

### `filter` rule parameters

The `filter` rule returns intervals based on a query. See [Filter example](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#interval-filter-rule-ex) for an example.

- **`after`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that follow an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`before`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that occur before an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`contained_by`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals contained by an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`containing`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that contain an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`not_contained_by`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that are **not** contained by an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`not_containing`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that do **not** contain an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`not_overlapping`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that do **not** overlap with an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`overlapping`**

  (Optional, query object) Query used to return intervals that overlap with an interval from the `filter` rule.

- **`script`**

  (Optional, [script object](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/modules-scripting-using.html)) Script used to return matching documents. This script must return a boolean value, `true` or `false`. See [Script filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-intervals-query.html#interval-script-filter) for an example.



## Example

### Filter example



1.  `hot` and `porridge`  之间不超过10个位置
2. 中间不能出现 *salty* 单词

```console
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "match" : {
          "query" : "hot porridge",
          "max_gaps" : 10,
          "filter" : {
            "not_containing" : {
              "match" : {
                "query" : "salty"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



### Script filters

You can use a script to filter intervals based on their start position, end position, and internal gap count. The following `filter` script uses the `interval` variable with the `start`, `end`, and `gaps` methods:

```console
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "match" : {
          "query" : "hot porridge",
          "filter" : {
            "script" : {
              "source" : "interval.start > 10 && interval.end < 20 && interval.gaps == 0"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```





### Minimization

间隙查询优先选择最小化间隔以确保查询在线性时间执行完毕

 This can sometimes cause surprising results, particularly when using `max_gaps` restrictions or filters. For example, take the following query, searching for `salty` contained within the phrase `hot porridge`:

```console
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "match" : {
          "query" : "salty",
          "filter" : {
            "contained_by" : {
              "match" : {
                "query" : "hot porridge"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query does **not** match a document containing the phrase `hot porridge is salty porridge`, because the intervals returned by the match query for `hot porridge` only cover the initial two terms in this document, and these do not overlap the intervals covering `salty`.



### Anyof

Another restriction to be aware of is the case of `any_of` rules that contain sub-rules which overlap. In particular, if one of the rules is a strict prefix of the other, then the longer rule can never match, which can cause surprises when used in combination with `max_gaps`. Consider the following query, searching for `the` immediately followed by `big` or `big bad`, immediately followed by `wolf`:

```console
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "all_of" : {
          "intervals" : [
            { "match" : { "query" : "the" } },
            { "any_of" : {
                "intervals" : [
                    { "match" : { "query" : "big" } },
                    { "match" : { "query" : "big bad" } }
                ] } },
            { "match" : { "query" : "wolf" } }
          ],
          "max_gaps" : 0,
          "ordered" : true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Counter-intuitively（与直觉相反，）,不会匹配 `the big bad wolf`  因为*any_of* 规则 优先匹配 *big* 间隔查询，而不会匹配  `big bad` 间隔查询，因为是基于最小化匹配原则

```console
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "any_of" : {
          "intervals" : [
            { "match" : {
                "query" : "the big bad wolf",
                "ordered" : true,
                "max_gaps" : 0 } },
            { "match" : {
                "query" : "the big wolf",
                "ordered" : true,
                "max_gaps" : 0 } }
           ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

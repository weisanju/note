## Total shards per node

集群层面的索引分配 尽可能的 将 单个索引的 分片分配到 更多的节点

但是，根据您拥有多少分片 和索引以及它们的大小，可能并不总是能够均匀地分布分片



以下动态设置允许您从每个节点允许的单个索引中指定分片总数的硬限制:

**`index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node`**

The maximum number of shards (replicas and primaries) that will be allocated to a single node. Defaults to unbounded.

您还可以限制节点可以具有的分片数量，而与索引无关:



**`cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node`**

([Dynamic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/settings.html#dynamic-cluster-setting)) Maximum number of primary and replica shards allocated to each node. Defaults to `-1` (unlimited).



Elasticsearch checks this setting during shard allocation. For example, a cluster has a `cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` setting of `100` and three nodes with the following shard allocations:

- Node A: 100 shards
- Node B: 98 shards
- Node C: 1 shard

If node C fails, Elasticsearch reallocates its shard to node B. Reallocating the shard to node A would exceed node A’s shard limit.

```
These settings impose a hard limit which can result in some shards not being allocated.

Use with caution.

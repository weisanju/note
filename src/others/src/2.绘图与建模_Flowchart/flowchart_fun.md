```
this app works by typing
 new lines create new nodes
  indentation creates child nodes 
  and any text: before a colon+space creates a label
 [linking] you can link to nodes using their ID in parentheses
  like this: (1)
  lines have a default ID of their line-number
   but you can also supply a custom ID in brackets
    like this: (linking) // use single line comments

/*
or 
multiline 
comments

Have fun! 🎉
*/
```



* 每一行代表一个结点
* 缩进创建一个结点
* 冒号+空格之前的 为 label
* 行号就是 默认id
* 可以自定义ID
* 如果某一行以 `(ID)` 开头则 表明上一个结点的指向
